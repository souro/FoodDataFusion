# The repository involves working with the [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data) dataset, focusing on three main parts:

## [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)]():


- Analyze the Open Food Facts dataset
- Extract useful statistics
- Identify data requirements for building an ML model that can extract nutritional table information from product images


## [ML Design]():


- Create a solution pipeline for extracting information from product images
- Focus on nutritional facts extraction
- Develop pseudocode demonstrating:
- Data splitting capabilities
- Handling multi-label classification
- Entity tagging
- Multimodal data loading (image and text)
- Model training and inference stages
- Good software engineering practices


## [Product Matching Challenge]():


- Work with two sets of product data
- Create matching product pairs
- Handle scenarios with limited positive matches
- Distinguish between easy and hard sample matches
- Develop a model for automatic product description matching
