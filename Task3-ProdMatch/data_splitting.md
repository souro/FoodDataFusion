##  Utilizing New Labeled Data After Deployment
- Incremental Learning
    - Update the model incrementally as new data arrives without retraining from scratch
    - Online learning algorithms
    - Progressive Neural Networks
- Retraining
    - On a regular intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly) to retrain the model using the updated dataset
